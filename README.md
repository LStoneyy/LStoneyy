## Fun facts
- I have two cats — one very thin, one very… committed to food 🐈🐈  
- I made music for years, but apparently not well enough to get rich from it  
- I genuinely enjoy learning new things and experimenting with new, emerging (or creative) technologies and tools
- I love reading as much as I love developing!
