# Hi, I’m Lukas 👋

I’m a former teacher training graduate (B.A. English & Technology), current researcher and student at RWTH Aachen, and a freelance full-stack developer and IT administrator. My work sits at the intersection of **education, technology, and software development**.

- **Academic research on AI in teaching and learning** (Cognitive, Digital and Empirical English Studies, RWTH Aachen)  
- Building and expanding my **full-stack web development portfolio**  
- Client projects through my freelance business **@webCommits web Designs**

## Tech & Tools
I work across different stacks depending on the project:
- **Backend & Infrastructure:** Python, Django, Docker, Nginx, Linux
- **Frontend & Static Sites:** Eleventy, Nunjucks, modern HTML/CSS
- **Web Apps & Animations:** React, Next.js, GSAP
- Many more, depending on what is needed! Always performance-focused, maintainable, and purpose-built

## Fun facts

- I made music for years, but apparently not well enough to get rich from it  
- I genuinely enjoy learning new things and experimenting with new, emerging (or creative) technologies and tools
- I love reading as much as I love developing!
